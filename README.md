Overview
This repository contains fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in Java. The linked list operations include:

Insertion: Adding elements dynamically.

Summation: Calculating the total sum of nodes.

Odd & Even Separation: Displaying and summing odd/even elements.

Nth Element Retrieval: Fetching the last element.

Alternate Element Display: Printing every alternate node.

Duplicate Detection: Identifying repeated elements.

This program provides a hands-on approach to linked list operations, essential for mastering DSA concepts. ðŸš€
