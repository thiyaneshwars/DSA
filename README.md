# Linked List Operations in Java

## Overview
This Java program implements various operations on a linked list, including:
- Inserting elements into the linked list
- Calculating the sum of elements
- Displaying odd and even elements separately with their sum
- Finding the last (nth) element
- Displaying alternate elements
- Detecting duplicate elements

## Features
- **Insert Elements**: Dynamically inserts user-provided integers into the linked list.
- **Sum of Elements**: Computes the total sum of all nodes in the linked list.
- **Odd & Even Elements**: Separately displays odd and even numbers along with their sum.
- **Nth Element**: Retrieves the last element of the linked list.
- **Alternate Elements**: Displays every alternate element in the list.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicate elements in the list.

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java program:
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```
3. Enter the number of elements you want to insert.
4. Enter the elements one by one.
5. The program will display the linked list and perform the operations.

## Example Input/Output
